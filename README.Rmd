<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of fishphylo is to import sequence data from GenBank and from Fasta files et construct phylogenetic trees.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jurenoult/fishphylo")
```
## Example 1: import sequences from GenBank

Load this project as a library:
```{r example}
library(fishphylo)
```

indicate taxa and the gene name
```{r}
ls_tax_gen <- cb_taxa_gene(c("Buenia","Pomatoschistus adriaticus"),"COI")
```

write a fasta file
```{r}
ls_fasta <-build_fasta(ls_tax_gen)
write_fasta(ls_fasta,"bueniaETpomadri_COI_seqs.fasta")
```
